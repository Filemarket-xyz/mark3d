## Simple Summary
A standard interface for NFT with encrypted image or hidden file
## Abstract
The following standard allows for implementation of a standard API for Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT) with encrypted image or hidden file.
The standard is an extension of ERC721 standard.
## Motivation
With Filecoin and FVM there is ability of building decentralized applications with
advanced logic with huge amount of data, such as encryption and decryption.

Encryption of NFT files (Hidden files) can solve problem of availability of content to anyone.

In other words, with Filecoin and FVM private NFT can be implemented.
## Transfer scheme concept
Key idea of this standard is to use some secret "password" for file encryption/decryption and 
to transfer token with "password" to hidden file.
Password cannot be transferred in the explicit way as in the blockchain everything is public.
So, here we are also required to use some encryption. This is the moment where asymmetric encryption
schemes fit very well

The scheme is following:
1. Receiver saves the public key in the blockchain
2. Sender encrypts the password and saves it in the blockchain
3. Receiver decrypts the password
4. Receiver decrypts the file and check if it is correct
5. If something went wrong receiver reports fraud and publishes private key and fraud-check-actor performs all decryption and reverts transfer if there is really fact of fraud
## Encryption
There are some requirements for encryption shemes:
1. Algorythm MUST be implemented and well tested in Rust programming language as it can be used in Filecoin native actor
2. Algorythm MUST be present in web browser API as ability of operating with encrypted data within user browser is strongly required

For file encryption AES protocol can be used and for password encryption RSA protocol. Both of them are present
in the browser API and in Rust.

Note: before encryption hash of file should be included. This hash can be used to check consistency after decryption.
## FEVM vs EVM
The difference between FEVM and EVM implementation is that we are unable to perform decryption on-chain in
case of fraud report. Because of that, this standard is extended with ability to do this with trusted 3rd party web2 solution.

While creating token contract instance trusted 3rd party address can be specified.

"Web2 solution" here is just a service, which filter logs and performs decryption in case of reports of fraud.
If this decryption fails, service is interacting with token contract and reverts transfer. And
if decryption is successful, service is interacting with token contract and finalized transfer.
## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
